This is my implementation, in Python, of the
["Build Your Own Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).
It is based on the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. For now, I have built a scanner that translates input into tokens.

**Note**: If you want to try the challenge yourself, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io).
